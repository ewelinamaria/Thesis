\chapter{Background estimation}
After the event selection described in a chapter \ref{chap:EventSelection} the background contribution is around \% for W and \% for Z analysis (which is with this statistics is  neglighable). Main backgrounds for W analysis are coming from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Processes with $\tau$ lepton, misidentified as a electron or muon + missing energy from neutrino
\item Z decays with one missing lepton.
\item QCD processes. In electron channel this is mostly coming from jets faking electrons, while in a muon channel it consists mostly of a real muons produced in decays of heavy-flavor mesons. %The $E_T^{miss}$ distribution is peaking
\end{itemize}
Most of the backgrounds are estimated using MC. They are normalized using highest cross-section order available. The total list of simulated backgrounds and its cross-section is shown in a Table \ref{tab:Backgrounds}
\include{tables/Backgrounds}
Due to a large cross-section uncertainty and high amount of events needed to be generated, QCD background is estimated using a data driven method.
