\chapter{Summary}
The measurement of $W\to l\nu$ and $Z\to ll$ cross-sections in electron and muon channels using $4 pb^{-1}$ \atlas data at center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV have been performed. The obtained data is used (assuming the lepton universality) for calculation of the combined cross-section and ratios of the W and Z cross-sections.

The uncertainty of these measurements is dominated by the limited statistics. Several sources of the systematic uncertainties were studied as well. The studies of the hadronic recoil calibration have been performed. The corresponding uncertainties have small, but not neglighable contribution to the systematic uncertainties of the W analyses. 

The contribution from the background processes have been estimated using both MC simulation and data-driven method.

The measured cross-section is compared to the both NLO and NNLO predictions for the different PDF set. The results are agreeing well with the theoretical predictions.

The measured data have been used for the PDF fits.
