\chapter{Summary}
This thesis presented the measurement of $W\to l\nu$ and $Z\to ll$ cross-sections at 2.76 TeV data. The cross-section have been measured separately in electron and muon channels and results are in a good agreement between each other.
The studies of calibration of hadronic recoil at 2.76 TeV data have been performed. The background contribution have been estimated using both simulation and data-driven techniques.
Experimental and theoretical uncertainties have been considered in a final cross-section. 
Obtained results have been used to test lepton universality and are in a good areement with standard model predictions.
Cross-section ratios have been estimated. All of the presented results are in a good agreement with theoretical predictions for different PDF sets.
